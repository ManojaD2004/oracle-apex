# Oracle APEX
The two projects of Oracle APEX USI and UTI submitted by team **DarkMode**, runner up, 2nd place in [Oracle Apex Xcelerate](https://inoaug.org/ords/r/inoaug/web/xcelerate-2024?session=8899937344077).

Export the apps to the Oracle APEX, and you will see the application live and running. 

# Note 
The data is not migrated by default, if you want to migrate it, look into the 'migration' folder. 
You can use the load data options in the data warehouse section of Oracle APEX, and load all the data, please keep in mind that Images and Notes (pdf) will not be migrated, which must be done from the application itself.

I finally want to Thank both of my teammates for working together alongside to bring the idea to life.
